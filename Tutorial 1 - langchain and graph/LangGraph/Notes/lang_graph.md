# Lang Graph

A framework for building controllable, persistent agent workflows with built-in support for human interaction, streaming, and state management.

It uses the Graph Data Structure to achieve this

Here are the key features of LangGraph based on the images provided:

## Key Features Of LangGraph

1.  **Looping and Branching Capabilities:** Supports conditional statements and loop structures, allowing dynamic execution paths based on state.
2.  **State Persistence:** Automatically saves and manages state, supporting pause and resume for long-running conversations.
3.  **Human-Machine Interaction Support:** Allows inserting human review during execution, supporting state editing and modification with flexible interaction control mechanisms.
4.  **Streaming Processing:** Supports streaming output and real-time feedback on execution status to enhance user experience.
5.  **Seamless Integration with LangChain:** Reuses existing LangChain components, supports LCEL expressions, and offers rich tool and model support.
