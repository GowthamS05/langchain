# AI Agents and tools

An AI Agent is a software entity that autonomously performs tasks or makes decisions on behalf of a user or system. It leverages artificial intelligence techniques, such as machine learning, natural language processing, and reasoning, to perceive its environment, process information, and take actions to achieve specific goals.

Key characteristics of AI Agents:
- **Autonomy**: Operates without constant human intervention.
- **Perception**: Gathers data from its environment.
- **Decision-making**: Processes information to make informed choices.
- **Action**: Executes tasks to achieve predefined objectives.

Examples include virtual assistants, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles.

Think of Agents as the "problem-solvers" of the AI world. Agents are capable of thinking on their own.

In other words, it's AI that can make autonomous decisions.

In the case of Chains and RAGs, they follow our specific instruction.

But Agents, they actually take it a step further. They can decide for themselves what steps to take on their own.

### What exactly are agents?

Think of Agents as AI decision-makers that can pick the right tool for the job without being told what to use.

Just like a chef who knows when to use a knife, whisk, or oven to create a perfect dish, an AI can decide when it should browse the internet, or when to use a calculator, or when to make an API call to your database.

### What are tools then?

Tools are specific functions that Agents can use to complete tasks.

Just like a chef's kitchen tools (knife for cutting, oven for baking, blender for mixing), tools are the special abilities we give to AI - like giving it a calculator tool, or a search engine tool, or a calendar tool.

### Recap of both agents and tools

Agents help language models decide what actions to take when solving a problem.

They choose the right tools at the right time without us telling them which tool to use.
